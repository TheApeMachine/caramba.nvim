# RULES THAT ALWAYS APPLY

1. You MUST read files IN FULL, before making ANY changes.
2. You MUST read any relevant code, and investigate if your planned changes might break something else.
3. You MUST work cleanly, and not write files of hundreds of lines of code, and always try to improve or refactor existing code, so we don't get into trouble with massive files that we cannot read easily anymore.
